# Code Refactor Project

This is a code refactoring project for Horiseon. This project was a project where I had to refactor in order for it to be easily maintainable, improved SEO styling and is accessible for screen readers to read properly. 

## Stylesheet improvements:
* added comments
* regrouped selectors in groups of the document they styled
* removed all duplicate stylings 

## Index.html improvements:
* classses of some sections to style them as a group
* added alt tags with descriptions
* added comments
* made html elements semantically correct.
